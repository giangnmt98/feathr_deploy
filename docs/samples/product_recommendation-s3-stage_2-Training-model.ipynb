    "This notebook illustrates the use of Feathr Feature Store to create a model that predict users' rating for different products for a e-commerce website.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Problem Statement\n",
    "The e-commerce website has collected past user ratings for various products. The website also collected data about user and product, like user age, product category etc. Now we want to predict users' product rating for new product so that we can recommend the new product to users that give a high rating for those products.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Creation Illustration\n",
    "In this example, our observation data has compound entity key where a record is uniquely identified by `user_id` and `product_id`. With that, we can think about three types of features:\n",
    "1. **User features** that are different for different users but are the same for different products. For example, user age is different for different users but it's product-agnostic.\n",
    "2. **Product features** that are different for different products but are the same for all the users.\n",
    "3. **User-to-product** features that are different for different users AND different products. For example, a feature to represent if the user has bought this product before or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will focus on the first two types of features. After we train a model based on those features, we predict the product ratings that users will give for the products.\n",

    "A feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon which is sometimes time-sensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Feathr, a feature is defined by the following characteristics:\n",
    "* The typed key (a.k.a. entity id): identifies the subject of feature, e.g. a user id of 123, a product id of SKU234456.\n",
    "* The feature name: the unique identifier of the feature, e.g. user_age, total_spending_in_30_days.\n",
    "* The feature value: the actual value of that aspect at a particular time, e.g. the feature value of the person's age is 30 at year 2022.\n",
    "* The timestamp: this indicates when the event happened. For example, the user purchased certain product on a certain timestamp. This is usually used for point-in-time join.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can feel that this is defined from a feature consumer (a person who wants to use a feature) perspective. It only tells us what a feature is like. In later sections, you can see how a feature consumer can access the features in a very simple way.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define how to produce the feature, we need to specify:\n",
    "* Feature source: what source data that this feature is based on\n",
    "* Transformation: what transformation is used to transform the source data into feature. Transformation can be optional when you just want to take a column out from the source data.\n",
